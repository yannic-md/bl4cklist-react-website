## 🤔 Introduction
› This project contains my complete design with all the functionalities of the Bl4cklist website, which I created for my own Discord server. I hope that maybe some people can learn something from it when they look at the project.

💝 › The project was developed by Yannic Drews and is actively maintained - user requests are welcome and are actively discussed together with a small Discord server team. :)

## 🛠️ What can i learn?
› `Bl4cklist Website` offers some fundamental features that help you better understand or apply basic concepts in certain areas.
<br />

🔎 › This project uses a handful third-party libraries: `Tailwind`, `Next.js`, and `JEST`.

It supports following <strong>features</strong>:
<ul> 
  <li>🖼️ <strong>Creative & beautiful design</strong>: We have put a lot of thought into the design of the website and wanted it to be something unique - we have put a lot of love and attention to detail into it.</li>
  <br /> 
  <li>💚 <strong>100% Unit-Test Coverage</strong>: Software testing is an important point when programming professionally for clients - we have tested all our TypeScript code, and you may be able to learn something from it.</li> 
  <br /> 
  <li>⚙️ <strong>Server-Side-Rendering</strong>: The landing page inside this little dashboard is using Angular's SSR to be optimized for Google and as fast as possible.</li> 
  <br /> 
  <li>🚩 <strong>Language Switcher</strong>: Our website automatically detects the language of your browser and displays English/German accordingly, alternatively the user can switch via button click.</li> 
  <br /> 
  <li>📱 <strong>Responsive for all Devices</strong>: We have put a special focus on ensuring that the website is beautifully and user-friendly displayed on as many devices as possible.</li> 
  <br />
  <li>🎈 <strong>Catchy Animations</strong>: As soon as an object comes into the user's field of view, a beautiful animation is played if applicable.</li> 
  <br />
  <li>⏳ <strong>Page-Loader</strong>: While the website is being built and all data is loading, a nice animated icon is displayed, which was built entirely with CSS.</li> 
</ul>

⚙️ › To run the <strong>test coverage</strong> and see the results, just open a terminal in the project root folder and run the command `jest`.
